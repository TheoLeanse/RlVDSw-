	1) Does he ingest the Real Body, or does he not?
	2) If he does not, what has become of it?
	3) If he does, what is to be done with him?

Mr Spiro now replied to these questions, that is
to say he replied to question one and he replied to
question three. He did so at length, quoting from Saint
Bonaventura, Peter Lombard, Alexander of Hales,
Sanchez, Suarez, Henno, Soto, Diana, Concina and Dens,
for he was a man of leisure. But Watt heard nothing
of this, because of other voices, singing, crying, stating,
murmuring, things unintelligible, in his ear. With
these, if he was not familiar, he was not unfamiliar
either. So he was not alarmed, unduly. Now these
voices, sometimes they sang only, and sometimes they
cried only, and sometimes they stated only, and sometimes
they murmured only, and sometimes they sang
and cried, and sometimes they sang and stated, and
sometimes they sang and murmured, and sometimes
they cried and stated, and sometimes they cried and
murmured, and sometimes they stated and murmured,
and sometimes they sang and cried and stated, and
sometimes they sang and cried and murmured, and
sometimes they cried and stated and murmured, and
sometimes they sang and cried and stated and murmured,
all together, at the same time, as now, to mention
only these four kinds of voices, for there were others.
And sometimes Watt understood all, and sometimes he
understood much, and sometimes he understood little,
and sometimes he understood nothing, as now.
