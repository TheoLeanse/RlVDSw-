        FADE IN

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE:

        INT. ENGINE ROOM

        Empty, cavernous.

        INT. ENGINE CUBICLE

        Circular, jammed with instruments.
        All of them idle.
        Console chairs for two.
        Empty.

        INT. OILY CORRIDOR - "C" LEVEL

        Long, dark.
        Empty.
        Turbos throbbing.
        No other movement.

        INT. CORRIDOR - "A" LEVEL

        Long, empty.

        INT. INFIRMARY - "A" LEVEL

        Distressed ivory walls.
        All instrumentation at rest.

        INT. CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE - "A" LEVEL

        Black, empty.

        INT. BRIDGE

        Vacant.
        Two space helmets resting on chairs.
        Electrical hum.
        Lights on the helmets begin to signal one another.
        Moments of silence.
        A yellow light goes on.
        Data mind bank in b.g.
        Electronic hum.
        A green light goes on in front of one helmet.
        Electronic pulsing sounds.
        A red light goes on in front of other helmet.
        An electronic conversation ensues.
        Reaches a crescendo.
        Then silence.
        The lights go off, save the yellow.

       INT. CORRIDOR TO HYPERSLEEP VAULT

        Lights come on.
        Seven gowns hang from the curved wall.
        Vault door opens.

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT

        Explosion of escaping gas.
        The lid on a freezer pops open.
        Slowly, groggily, KANE sits up.
        Pale.
        Kane rubs the sleep from his eyes.
        Stands.
        Looks around.
        Stretches.
        Looks at the other freezer compartments.
        Scratches.
        Moves off.
